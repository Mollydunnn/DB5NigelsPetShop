# DB5NigelsPetShop
Final project from COMP 353: Database Programming

Submission by Molly Dunn, Jaimiie Riemenschneider, and Anne Wagner

As a team of three, we collaborated  to create a functioning web application to facilitate purchases and transactions in relation to a created database. Our database project is a website for an organization, Nigel’s Pet Shop, which aims to facilitate pet adoptions and supply those owners with the necessary supplies to care for their new pet. The purpose of this application is to allow people to buy inventory and adopt pets via Nigel’s Pet Shop’s website, which includes being able to see the basic information on  the animals available for adoption. 

Skills utilized: MongoDB, Anaconda Navigator, MAMP, SQL scripts, Python, and HTML
